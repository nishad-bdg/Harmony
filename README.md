# Harmony
A multi-purpose Discord bot for the Lucid Academy Discord server

## Setup
The first step is to create a `config.py` file in the root directory with the following template:
```
EXTENSIONS = [
  'extensions.statistics'
]
PREFIX = '?'
token = 'PUT YOUR TOKEN HERE'
MYSQL_DATABASE = ''
MYSQL_HOST = ''
MYSQL_PASSWORD = ''
MYSQL_USERNAME = ''
```

Once you've done that, you'll be able to run the bot by running the `harmony.py` file.
